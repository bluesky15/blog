# PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor)

PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer **Rasmus Lerdorf** in 1994.

## PHP syntax

This is how you do it. You can write your all the code inside the angle brackets. Start angle bracket qustion mark "php" and ending with qustion mark ending angle bracket this identifies the php code block inside the HTML.

```php
<?php
// All the code goes inside the angle brackets.
echo 'hello world';
//end of code.
?>
```

### Comments

Comments are very important in programming. Most of the programming languages follow the same kind of comment syntax.

```php
<?php
//this is a single_line comment.
# This is also a single-line comment
echo 'hello world Again!';
/* Multi_line comment block,
* which spans over multiple lines.
*/
?>
```

### Variables

In programming, a variable is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program. In PHP, a variable starts with the *$* sign, followed by the name of the variable.

```php
<?php
$greet = "Hi There"; // string variable
$times = 3; //integer
$weight = 78.5; //floating point
?>
```
